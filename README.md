# Decimal Explorer

An interactive tool to help children learn about decimals by visualizing how they break down into whole numbers, tenths, hundredths, and thousandths.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser
2. Enter a decimal number (between 0 and 10) in the input field
3. Click "Visualize" or just change the number to see the visual representation update
4. Observe how the number breaks down into different place values:
   - Blue squares represent whole numbers (1.0)
   - Green rectangles represent tenths (0.1)
   - Red squares represent hundredths (0.01)
   - Orange dots represent thousandths (0.001)

## Features

## Teaching Tips

- Start with simple numbers like 1.5 or 2.3 to introduce the concept
- Progress to numbers with hundredths and thousandths
- Ask students to predict what the visualization will look like before entering a number
- Challenge students to create a specific visual pattern by entering the right number
- Discuss real-world applications of decimals (money, measurements, etc.)

## Compatibility
